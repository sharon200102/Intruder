# 🔍 Find the Intruder – Computer Vision Workshop  

You are given thermal videos from a secret camera placed deep in enemy territory.  
Your mission: automatically detect and track every moving object (bright blob) no matter how  chaotic the scene gets.  

You’ll start with static blobs on a black background and progress to multiple moving objects hidden inside grid patterns and noise.  
By the end you’ll learn about localization, motion detection and background separation — all core computer vision skills.

Pure hands-on fun. Let’s catch those intruders!

**Quick start**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sharon200102/Intruder.git
cd Intruder
pip install -e .
```
open the notebook at src/intruder/student_code/task1.ipynb and you are good to go
